    <h2>Older versions</h2>
    <p><a href="main_ecs_v1.html">ECS v1</a> (Deprecated) Flags are separate components, Gui refs not generic enough, no plain data components</p>
    <p><a href="main_oo_v1.html">OO v1</a> (Deprecated) Stored display options both centrally and in each mediator.  312
    lines of code (new version is 279 lines). This implemenation had a <code>display_options</code> mediator (as a Subject for a change, usually
    mediators are observers of model subjects). Then <code>mediator_welcome_left</code> and
    <code>mediator_welcome_user_right</code> observed display_options, and updated their own internal flags to match the
    display options flags. This is rather clever, but also convoluted. The checkbox GUI handlers, instead of updating a
    global display options "view" model (and the resulting observer notifications happening) could instead take the
    <b>simpler</b> approach of modifying the flags in each mediator directly - which is what I implemented later.  This
    then also allows the removal of the uppercase_all flag, since we no longer have a murky global view model, but
    instead a specific view model in each mediator (see dicussion of this topic of dropping the 3rd flag, in
    esper_extras.py). Note: The price to pay for this simplification is that in the checkbox handlers, you have to
    trigger manually because mediator_dump_models cannot subscribe to this change, as this is a gui event, not a Subject
    which can be subscribed to. viz. you have to <code>mediator_dump_models.notify(null, "display options
    change")</code>. But since GUI needs to be recomputed, might as well do the simpler <code>model.dirty_all()</code>.
      </p>
    <p><a href="main_oo_v2.html">OO v2</a> (Deprecated) where the event handlers set properties then
      had to manually notify() them of the change. Better approach is to have setters on the mediators, where they can auto
      notify themselves.  This way, in the OO architecture, GUI event handler functions either set values on model object or
      on controller objects - simple.

      <p>
        <a href="main_oo_v3_observer.html">OO v3 Object Oriented observer</a>
        (Deprecated) Traditional Observer design pattern implementation (340
        lines), with Models inheriting from Subject and Mediators inheriting
        from Observer. Turns out to the be biggest! Replaced by idiomatic event
        based pub/sub system more natural to Javascript, which removes the
        explicit, 'old fashioned (i.e. not idiomatic to Javascript)'
        Observer/Subject classes from which Models and Controllers inherit - in
        favour of a Javascript native pub/sub mechanism, like
        document.dispatchEvent() from subject functions and
        document.addEventListener() on observing functions
